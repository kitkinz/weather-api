# üå¶Ô∏è Weather API
A simple C# .NET Web API that fetches and returns weather data from a third-party provider.  
Instead of maintaining our own dataset, this project integrates with external APIs (e.g., [Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api)).

[Project Task on Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/weather-api-wrapper-service)

## üöÄ Features
- Fetch real-time weather data from a 3rd party API  
- Use in-memory caching (e.g., Redis) to reduce unnecessary API calls  
- Configurable API keys and settings via environment variables  
- Automatic cache expiration (e.g., 12 hours) for fresh results

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **.NET 6+** (ASP.NET Core Web API)  
- **Redis** (recommended for caching)
